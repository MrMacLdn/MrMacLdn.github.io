                <p>
                    A chatbot is a computer program that simulates and interprets human conversation, this allows users to communicate with digital devices as if they were talking to real people.  <br>
                    The bot will first analyze the user's input then it identifies intent and entites and it will compose a response. <br>
                    Natural language processing (NLP) is a machine-learning technology that allows computers to understand, manipulate, and comprehend human language. <br>
                    NLP uses AI to take real-world input, process it, and make sense of it so the computer can understand. <br>

                <h2> What are some real-world examples and application where NLP and chatbots are used?</h2>
                <p>
                    Chatbots, speech recognition, text summarization and machine translation are a few examples of real-world applications of NLP.  <br>
                    Chatbots can used for content creation, translation, writing code, code debugging, code refactoring, code documentation.  <br>

                <h2> What are some benefits and drawbacks of NLP and chatbots and what are some ethical considerations?</h2>
                <p>
                    NLP allows for analyzing larger data sets, providing more objective analysis, streamlining daily processes, improving customer experience, and extracting actionable insights.  <br>
                    NLP also has drawbacks such as processing contextual words and phrases and homonyms, synonyms, irony and sarcasm, and sland. NLP might also have errors in speech or text. NLP also has ethical considerations such as bias, privacy, and transparency.  <br>
                    Chatbots have benefits like being available 24/7, giving instant responses, being multilingual, and giving consistent answers.  <br>
                    Chatbots also have drawbacks such as being unable to handle angry/annoying customers, not being suitable for all businesses and applications, being unable to handle complex queries, and unawareness of context. Chatbots also have ethical considerations such as privacy, transparency, accuarcy, safety, and accountability.   <br>
