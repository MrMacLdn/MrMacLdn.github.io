                <h2>Techniques and Methods Used</h2>
                <p>Cyber criminals use internet protocol spoofing to gain access to devices and sensitive information. IP spoofing happens when cyberattackers alter the source IP address of a website, email address, or device to mask it.</p>
                <p>Cyber criminals use domain name system spoofing to alter domain names and redirect users to fake websites operated by cybercriminals. This tricks users into thinking they are on a secure and trusted website.</p>
                <p>Cyberattackers can hijack emails and gain control of email accounts and other financial departments to monitor to see any transactions. They can also fake the bankâ€™s email address and send instructions to make customers unknowingly transfer their money to cyber criminals.</p>

                <h2>Measures and Practices to Defend Against Attacks</h2>
                <p>Organizations should employ encryption standards to protect data in use or at rest. For data shared into, within, and out of an organization, encryption of the data at the file and volume levels is requisite. This helps ensure that cybercriminals and rogue nation-states are not able gain access to the data, even if they gain some level of access.</p>
