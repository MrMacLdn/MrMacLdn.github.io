                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <p>Artificial intelligence, AI for short, is the intelligence of machines or software. It mimics brain functions that can reason, learn, and act intelligently.</p>

            <section id="real-world-examples-and-applications">
                <h2>Real-World Examples and Applications</h2>
                <p>AI ethics issues include data responsibility and privacy, fairness, explainability, robustness, transparency, environmental sustainability, inclusion, moral agency, value alignment, accountability, trust, and technology misuse. AI isn’t a person, and can have bias based on it’s creator and given information. </p>

                <h2>Potential Benefits and Drawbacks</h2>
                <p>Some benefits of AI are decreasing time to complete tasks, such as data management.  AI algorithms, for example, can analyze millions of data points in real-time to identify patterns, trends, and insights that humans would find difficult or time-consuming to detect and write out. 
                It can also help automate tasks and processes, such as scheduling, research, problem solving, writing content, communicating important messages to stakeholders, ideation on new products and summarizing large amounts of text. Artificial intelligence has drawbacks in cost, unemployment, and deficient creativity.</p>

                <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
                <p>The misuse of the power AI has become a prevalent worry in today’s society. People are trying to draw a line between what is and isn’t too much access to information for Artificial Intelligence. Concerns have arisen about how AI will perform in the real world, as a self-driving machine or as a server in a restaurant. 
                Whether the broken self-driven car will have features to stop any accidents from occuring. There are many ethical considerations and questions AI is facing as it becomes more viewed.</p>

                <h2>Artificial Intelligence's Impact on Careers in the Future</h2>
                <p>AI may affect many careers, especially those online and not required to have social relation. An example of a career with qualities of this sort is a data manager. AI can efficiently and quickly go over excessive amounts of data and instantaneously give information about it, making it a competitor for jobs of similar manner.</p>
