              What are NLP and ChatBots? 
            </div>
            <div class="item">
              NLP stands for Natural Language Processing; NLP makes AI able to understand human language and abbreviations. This has made it possible for computers to understand us and what we are communicating with it. NLP uses mathematical algorithms to process and study human language data. NLP tools can transform text into something that a computer can understand. Chatbots are an application that everyone can get, you can input text and it will give you an answer to the information that it has access to. It uses NLP to understand what we are saying and then uses NLP to give us an answer in our language.

              There are very many examples of NLP, it is used for Chatbots like chat GPT, it is used in things like PowerPoint, word, google docs for speech recognition for speech to text. It is used as an email filter to filter out spam and possible malicious emails. It is also used for language translation for something like google translate. Some real-life examples of Chatbots are used for work, like possible fixing errors in code or summarizing text to help people understand it better.

              Some potential benefits to NLP are to further computers' understanding of us and how we speak our language. It also can take very large amounts of text at once and understand what it is about and what it means. It also can help big companies sort tickets and respond to possible customer tickets to help improve something about the company. It is mostly used as a benefit for customer satisfaction, so companies donâ€™t have to respond to every single message that they get, instead they can use NLP to understand and respond to their customers. There are also some drawbacks to NLP, it can be very unpredictable, and you have no idea what it will think about the text. It is not perfect ye so it can be incorrect with something like speech to text, you might say hello and it could think you said hallow. It also does not know any context to what you're saying so it can be hard to fully understand what your text means. Some benefits of chatbots are that they can almost be better than an internet browser because they can give you a summary of all of the information across the internet instead of you having to go to all of the websites reading for the right information.

            <div class="item">
              NLP does not have very many ethical concerns, the only one really is that NLP can be bias this can be unethical because it can give you incorrect text and you can spared incorrect information. But Chatbots do have some ethical concerns, they can be easily used to cheat in school. This is a big problem for all levels of school because a chatbot like chat GPT can create an essay for a book at all levels. It can make something at a grade school level or a university level.
