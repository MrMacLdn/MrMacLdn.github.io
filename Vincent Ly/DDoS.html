                <h3>Definition and Description</h3>
                <p>A DDoS attack is an attack in which hackers flood a server with internet traffic preventing
                  users from connecting to servers and sites. A DDoS attack depending on the severity can last up to a day or more.
                  Signs of a DDoS attack are slow or unresponsive servers that display "Too many connections".
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h3>Techniques and Methods Used in Attacks</h3>
                <p>In a DDoS attack UDP floods, ICMP floods, and other spoofed packet floods.
                  These infracture layered attacks are aimed to overload the capacity of the network or application servers

                <p>The impact of the DDoS attack took Github offline for five minutes, although being knocked offline Github had said that none of the confidential or important data was ever at risk.
