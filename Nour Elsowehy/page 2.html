                <h2> How Phising Attacks can be harmful to people and organizations</h2>
                <p>
             Phishing Attacks really disrupt an organization's operations. 
             Once an attacker has found their way arond the network, they can 
             install malware or ransomware which can lead to system outages and other
             disruptions to your network. In 2020 there was a survey which identified phising ayyacks as the most harmful 
             cyber atttack in the UK, which isn't much of a suprise, if you know how distributive they can be to an 
             organization. After a phishing attack it takes around 24 hours to restore all the information and assets 
             an organization has lost, which stops work, and the organization loses money. For individuals who have come 
             to be a victim of a phishing attack, after the fact they may feel very helpless and taken advantage of. 
             This can lead to anxiety, stress, and other emotional disruptions.
