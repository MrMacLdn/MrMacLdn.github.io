                    cyber atttack in the UK, which isn't much of a suprise, if you know how distributive they can be to an 
                    organization. After a phishing attack it takes around 24 hours to restore all the information and assets 
                    an organization has lost, which stops work, and the organization loses money. For individuals who have come
