                Zero Day Exploits, What are they and How are they carried out?
            </h3>

            <p>
                <br>
                Zero Day Exploits are a method of attacking systems through a previously unidentified vulnerability.
                 Exploits are sold for large sums of money on the Dark Web.
                 Once an exploit has been discovered and patched, it is no longer considered a Zero-Day threat.

            <h3>
                How are Zero-Day Exploits used?
            </h3>

            <p>
                <br>
                Zero-Day Exploits are used by attackers to target usually large corparations. <br>
                A zero-day exploit is a type of cyber attack used to target a software vulnerability that is 
                unknown to the software or antivirus vendors. The attacker will spot the vulnerability, and will
                create an exploit targerting such vulnerability and use it for an attack. These types of cyber attackers
                are very highy likely to succeed because there is no defenses in place, therefor making
                zero-day attacks a very severe security threat. Some of the typical targets for this exploit are;
                Government departments, large enterprises, hardware devices, individuals with access to valuable business
                data, and governments themselves even use them to attack organizations, individuals, or countries threatening
                their national security

                <h3> Code Red Worm (July 2001) </h3>
                There has been many large-scale zero-day attacks, with many consequences.
                The first example, was one not to steal data, but to cause disruptions. So called, Code Red Worm,
                in 2001 was an attack on Microsoft's Internet Information Services (IIS)
                web server software. The attack lasted from July 13-20th in 2001 and the criminals
                who conducted this attack still have not been found. This attack had global implications, infecting over 350,000 servers worldwide,
                demonstrating the threat of these exploits. The worm itself, targeting businesses and government agencies using Microsoft's ISS, a popular
                choice for web servers. It defaced these webpages, and replaced them with the message, "Hacked by Chinese!"
                Financially, this attack costed an estimated $2.6 billion in damages. Following this attack, it highlighted the 
                importance of regular software updates and more robust cybersecurity measures.

            <h3> LinkedIn (June 2021) </h3>
            One of the more recent attacks, was targetting LinkedIn.
            LinkedIn is the world's largest professional network on the internet.
            People use LinkedIn to find the right intership or job, connect and strengthen
            professional relationships, and to learn the skills you need to succeed
            in your career. In June of 2021, a hacker accessed data by exploiting the sites
            Application Programming Device (API). The attack affected 700 million users, more than 90%
            of LinkedIn's users. Since this attack, the group responsible has publicly released
            a data set containing the personal information of around 500 million users, while threatening to
            sell the entire set of data, containing the full 700 million users. The stolen data contained; users 
            email addresses, phone numbers, geolocation records, genders, and social media details. This data could be used
            to create scams.

            <h3>What are the Impacts of a Zero-Day Exploit </h3>
            <p>
                <br>
                Zero-Day exploits are one of the most severe cyper attacks.
                Zero-Day exploits can be used to steal money, data, or intellectual property from their target.
                Common targets include but are not limited to; traders, local businesses, national chains, and even huge global giant companies like Google.
                No companies are immune or safe from these attacks, as they are nearly impossible to find until the weakness is located.
                Zero-Day attacks are extremeley dangerous for society, because the attacks can leak private information, and sometimes your information can even be sold on the dark web without your knowledge.
                They are also dangerous for business owners, because they can lose valuable business data, and even money.

            <h3>How Do You Defend Against a Zero-Day Exploit? </h3>
            <p>
                <br>
                Zero-Day Exploits are so dangerous because they are incredibly hard to defend against.
                Zero-Day exploits use zero-day vulnerabilities to attack their target, which are vulnerabilities unidentified by the target.
                Because the vulnerability is unknown, the target is usually oblivious to the attack until it is too late.
                There are some ways however, to find these vulnerabilities before they are exploited by cybercriminals, or to detect the suspicious 
                activity before too much damage is done<br>
                <br>

                <b>1. Regular Updates:</b> a simple way to prevent cybercriminals from exploiting a vulnerability, is to keep systems updated, while it is nearly impossible
                to have absolutely zero vulnerabilities but keeping your software updated is a good start.<br>
                <b>2. Be Prepared:</b> since it is so difficult to detect zero-day exploits before they are executed, it is a good idea to be prepared for one.
                You won't be able to control how you get attacked, but you can control exactly how you react to an attack. 
                Having a solid plan in place keeps you ready for an attack whenever it might come.<br>
                <b>3. Use Security Software:</b> another simple way to protect yourself and your business, is to use security software.
                Some examples, are Wiz, Wiz is one of the best rated vulnerability scanners available. Another great security tool is Security QRadar SIEM.
                QRadar SIEM is a combination of many security tools that both perform security information monitoring, and security event management software.
                This program provides a single platform to analyize security logs in real time, investigate, detect anomalies, and remediate threats.
                You can use QRadar SIEM to; <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Automate threat response</li>
                    <li>Monitor for abnormalities and threats in your IT system</li>
                    <li>Gather threat information</li>
                    <li>Collect and store IT security data</li>
                </ul>
