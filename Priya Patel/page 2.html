                <h2> What is computer vision and recognition? </h2>

                    Computer vision and image recognition  is a field of
                     artificial intelligence and is  what computers use to
                      determine patterns and objects in digital images. It 
                      allows the computer to identify various things like
                       people, and words within an image. It involved 
                       understanding and analyzing images and videos. It
                        is used in numerous fields like surveillance and
                         image recognition. Image recognition focuses more
                          on detecting the objects in the image and 
                          patterns, whereas, computer vision is more 
                          focused on detecting the object, spatial 
                          arrangement and context of the image. The way 
                          it works is that it uses a combination of
                           machine learning, artificial intelligence, 
                           and trained algorithms to detect images through
                            a camera system. Computer vision algorithms 
                            work to process and extract data. Image 
                            recognition algorithms compare this data to
                             a database to further analyze the information.

                <h2> Real life examples</h2>
                <p>
          
One example is facial recognition technology, which is used in 
smartphones to unlock our devices by scanning our faces. Another
 example is in self-driving cars, where computer vision helps the 
 car see  and understand its surroundings. For example, it can detect 
 traffic lights and people who are walking in the streets. Computer
  vision is also used in medical imaging. It helps doctors analyze X-rays,
   MRIs, and CT scans to treat different health issues.  It  is used in 
   security systems to detect  suspicious things.

                <h2> Applications </h2>
                <p>
                    We can see applications of computer vision and image 
                    recognition in our daily lives. It’s pretty cool how it
                    can be used in everyday things that you don’t even think 
                    about. Take facial recognition for example, this 
                    technology is found on smartphones to unlock the device 
                    by scanning your face. And let's not forget self-driving 
                    cars. Before they do what they do, they need to understand
                     their surroundings just like you would when driving. 
                     Computer vision helps them “see” and do this by detecting
                      pedestrians and traffic signs. You can also find it 
                      within medical imaging to diagnose diseases and injuries 
                      using x-rays, MRIs, etc. Lastly security systems use it
                       to detect any suspicious activities or objects. With 
                       all these uses for only one thing, it makes a lot that
                        much easier and safer.

            <h2> Benefits  </h2>
            <p>
           
The first benefit is that computers can do more difficult
 tasks that would usually require human intervention. For
  example, computer vision and image recognition can help 
  robots sort our objects. The next benefit is that images 
  can be analyzed with attention to detail. This is beneficial 
  in the medical field, where image recognition and computer 
  vision can help during the diagnosis process of various diseases. 
  The next benefit is that efficiency for various tasks can be
   increased. For example, farmers can use image recognition and 
   computer vision to detect diseases and other issues with their
    crops, which is faster than having a human inspect every crop.

        <h2> Drawbacks</h2>
        <p>
            The first disadvantage is limited c
            ontext awareness. Computer vision and
             image recognition interprets what is in 
             front of them, rather than the context. 
             This can lead to misinterpretations. ‘
 The next drawback is that computer vision and image 
 recognition can only work on data they are trained for. 
 If the data is incomplete, then it will be harder to interpret 
 it, thus, it can lead to inaccurate results. The last drawback
  is privacy concerns. The systems may be tracking people's behaviors
   without their consent, which can worry some people.

    <h2> Ethics</h2>
    <p>
        Some of the ethical implications of computer 
        vision and image recognition are, privacy invasion, 
        bias, consent neglection, and security issues.
