                    An insider threat can be defined <br>
                    as a cyber security risk that comes from <br>
                    people within an organization. They use their <br>
                    authorized access to negatively impact the <br>
                    organization's resources,network, systems, etc.

                <h2> Insider threat techniques</h2>
                <p>
                    The first insider threat technique is data theft. 
                    Taking pictures of private documents and sending
                    emails to private accounts are ways this can occur.
                     Hacking, financial gain, and revenge are all reasons
                     as to why this can happen. The next technique is 
                    privilege escalation. By getting privileges to use
                     and abuse private resources, this can occur. The
                    next technique is sabotage. This can occur from 
                    the desire for revenge or blackmail purposes. 
                    Instead of stealing data, their objective is 
                     to occur or delete it. The three types of insider 
                    threats are, malicious insiders,compromised insiders, 
                    and  negligent insiders. Malicious insider threats 
                     harm the integrity of the company. Negligent insider 
                     threats are when an individual within the 
                     organization puts sacred information at risk, 
                     as a result of a lack of attention, human error,
                      or disregarded security protocols. Compromised 
                      insider threats refers to people within an 
                      organization who had their access compromised stolen
                       by outside l threat actors. Employees, contractors, 
                       or business partners may misuse important data, 
                       which can cause harm to the organization in many
                        ways.

                <h2> Real life examples </h2>
                <p>
                    The first real life example of this attack is when an 
                    employee who was leaving Yahoo stole trading secrets.
                    This happened in May of 2022, when he stole 
                    information about Yahoo's new Adlearn product. He 
                     downloaded around 570,000 pages of Yahoo's ip to his
                    own devices. The information he had would have been
                    enough to give competitors a great advantage. 
                    The next real life example is the departing google 
                    employee who bought data of the company back in 2016.
                     He downloaded thousands of files of Google's self-
                    driving program onto his personal devices, in hopes
                    that it will give him an advantage for his uber 
                    job. The last real life example is the insider at
                    BGupa who stole and sold company data on the black
                     web, for his own financial gain. This happened 
                     back in 2017. He got all the information he 
                     needed on a CRM, and then sold it on the black 
                     market, to about 550, 000 people. 
                     Lastly, is the insider at Boering who sent 
                     private company information to a personal email. 
                    He forwarded a spreadsheet that contains private 
                      information about the company, to his wife in hopes 
                     that she can help him with formatting. In the hidden 
                     column it had about 36,000 of his co-workers'
                      personal information.

            <h2> Impact</h2>
            <p>
                The impact insider threats have on individuals is that it
                can lead to feelings of mistrust and  stress. If the threat 
                involved a friend or coworker they trusted, this can lead to
                 a strain in people's relationships.  The loss of trust they 
                 feel can cause job dissatisfaction. Insider attacks can lead 
                 to personal data being compromised, which can lead to identity 
                 theft or cause an individual to experience significant financial 
                 loss. If someone's personal information like financial and medical
                 records are stolen, this can lead to identity theft. The stress
                that comes with this, can lead to financial distress and
                 excessive stress. Insider thre­ats can harm society by eroding 
                 trust and compromising security. Whe­n individuals abuse their
                  authorized acce­ss to sensitive information or systems, it can 
                  re­sult in breaches across national security, public safe­ty,
                 and critical infrastructure. Such repercussions e­xtend far
                  beyond immediate­ consequences, impacting the­ stability 
                  and proper functioning of society as a whole. Additionally,
                this misconduct has the­ potential to undermine public 
                 confide­nce in institutions and systems establishe­d to 
                 safeguard and support communities.Insider thre­ats pose a 
                 considerable risk to organizations, le­ading to both
                    financial and reputational harm. When insiders with 
                    malicious inte­nt steal intellectual prope­rty, trade 
                    secrets, or se­nsitive business information, their 
                    compe­titors gain an unfair advantage. As a 
                    consequence­, affected organizations can suffer 
                    significant financial losse­s, lose market share,
                     and e­ven face bankruptcy. Additionally, insider 
                     thre­ats bring negative publicity and erode­ trust
                      in the organization, making it more challenging 
                      to attract custome­rs and partners.

        <h2> Measures for this attack</h2>
        <p>
     
A key me­asure in preventing and addre­ssing insider threats is 
impleme­nting robust access controls. This entails granting access 
to spe­cific information or systems solely to those individuals who 
re­quire it for their roles. By doing so, unauthorize­d parties are
preve­nted from accessing sensitive­ data, effectively minimizing the
­ risk of insider threats. Regularly monitoring and auditing syste­m 
activity is another effective­ measure. This means ke­eping a close eye­ on
 employees' compute­r activities and watching for any suspicious or 
 abnormal behavior. By actively monitoring and auditing, it be­comes
  easier to ide­ntify signs of insider threats and take prompt action 
  to pre­vent any potential harm.
