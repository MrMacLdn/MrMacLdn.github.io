                <p>There are many attacks but ill be talking about 2 first ill be talking about SYN floods also known as half opend attacks. SYN flood attacks are when someone sends many nubers of SYN requests and dont respond to the servers SYN attack message.

                <h2> Why is preventing this attack important</h2>
                <p>
                If your computer were to get attacked this would lead to loss of data and other reasorces.
                Getting attacked by a DDOS attack will tire out your applications making it univalible for some users. <br>
