                            <h3> Risks and Consequences of Cyber Attacks </h3>
                            <p> Cyber-attacks come in many different shapes and sizes, meaning that it can cause a wide range of harm. One of the most common consequences is economic loss. An example of this could be having your credit card information stolen. On top of that, if you oversee a website, it will cost the company money to get our site and resources fixed and up and running again. A cyber-attack on our company can cause issues such as damaging our reputation and/or damaging the other businesses that rely on us for factors of production. To keep our good reputation and business partners, all employees of GlobeTech Technology must stay vigilant when going online. </p>

                            <h3> How to Stay Safe Online </h3>
                            <p> On the bright side of things, there are many methods one can use to stay safe online. The best way to keep your data safe is using strong, difficult, and different passwords for each program. In fact, when Google or Apple gives you the option to save your password, it is best to not do that so no information will be there if you get hacked. However, it is important that you do keep track of your passwords somehow so that you do not forget them. 2-step verification is also a terrific way to keep some of your important accounts safe. While nobody hopes that GlobeTech Technology fall victim to a cyber-attack, it is important to be prepared. As a result, keeping all your important work data backed up is necessary. This way, if something happens, we can immediately resume working at our normal schedule. </p>
