                <h1> What are Zero-Day Exploits? </h1> 
                <p>
                    When programmers are constructing software, they unknowingly create a vulnerability in the code that a hacker finds and exploits. While exploiting the vulnerability, the hacker can cause damage and steal data. Zero-day exploits happen unexpectedly because hackers target vulnerabilities that are not yet known. In fact, attackers exploited 55 vulnerabilities in 2022. Zero-day exploits are often only executed by the most experienced and creative hackers because they require a lot of knowledge and time. In some cases, people hire hackers to find zero-day vulnerabilities. This service is sometimes sold for well over $1 million. </p>
                <h1> What Meathods are Used to Carry Out this Attack? </h1>
                <p>
                    As mentioned, zero-day exploits require a lot of creativity on the hacker's part, so there are many methods and techniques they can use to preform it. That being said, it can be successful with if hackers only follow a few simple steps. First, hackers will the find the vulnerability/vulnerabilities they want to target, then while it is still active, they implement a code to take advantage of it (this code is often referred to as an “exploit code”). To identify the systems that are more vulnerable than others, bots or automated scanners are often used. When they have done this, they need to find a way to reach the vulnerability. The most common (and simplest) way to do this is by sending an email pretending to be correspondent to somebody involved in the program. In the email, they write to convince them to go to a malicious website or open a certain file. When they do this, it downloads the attacker's malware, making the zero-day exploit a success.
                </p>
                <h1> Some Examples of this Attack... </h1>
                <p>
                    There have been many large scale zero-day exploits that have affected people and companies during the past few years. <br>
                    <br> 
                    1. One example is the “Stuxnet Worm” vulnerability. The most well-known zero-day hack to date attacked Iranian nuclear plants using four different zero-day security flaws. The centrifuges in the factories were shut down, their speed changed, and they suffered damage from a self-replicating computer worm. <br>
                    2. The Spring4Shell zero-day vulnerability, found in the Spring core Java framework, enabled attackers to remotely inject malicious code into targets' computers. <br>
                    3. In June 2023, Chinese-sponsored group Hafnium attacked Microsoft Exchange email servers by utilizing several zero-day vulnerabilities, breaching governments and companies all over the world.

                <h1> Impacts of Zero-Day Exploits </h1>
                <p>
                    Zero-day exploits are one of the most severe malware threats to this day for many reasons. It is impossible to see an attack coming or patch a vulnerability before it is discovered by a hacker, it can take a long time for it to be noticed, and it takes a long time to patch the issue in the code. These attacks can be especially dangerous to businesses, since the hackers can steal money, intellectual property, and data. When considering the facts that most software has some minuscule mistakes and that it is impossible to predict this type of attack, it is safe to say that nobody is immune to a zero-day exploit. 
                </p>
                <h1> How to Defend Against Zero-Day Exploits </h1>
                <p>
                    Since this attack is focused on vulnerabilities that are unknown to the owners of the software, hackers often succeed because there are no defenses already in place. An option to keep your software safe is using Window’s Defender Exploit Guard. Windows released this in 2010, including many features that can be used to defend against these attacks. They have an Attack Surface Reduction (ASR), network protection, and controlled folder access. If not, one can use Leverage’s Next-Generation Antivirus (NGAV). This technology cannot detect all types of zero-day malware, but it can reduce the chances that attackers penetrate software. They offer leverage threat intelligence and analyze behavioral analytics, which allows the system to identify suspicious activity much quicker.
